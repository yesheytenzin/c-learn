equality operator is a unique case. where == does not mean assignment but is used to compare if the left operand is equal to the right operand or not. simillarly != checks if left operand is not equal to right operand. they are also left associatove and produce 1 or 0. andthey have lower precedence than realtional operator.

eg: i > j == k > l is same as (i > j) == (k > l)
as relational and equality operatos are integer values, they can e exploited.
eg:  (i >= j) + (i == j) is either 0,1 or 2
if bothe the relational statements are true -- result is 2 and if only one is true we get 1.
if only both is false then we get 0.

however this is not a good idea to implment in programs as it makes program difficult to understand.
