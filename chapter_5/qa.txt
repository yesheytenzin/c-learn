1) My compiler doesn't give a warning when I use= instead of == Is there some
way to force the compiler to notice the problem? --> when using i == 0, some programmer may use 0 == i, in this case if a user writes
0 = i instead if 0 == i, an error message would be generated as as it s not possible to assign to 0. however this makes the program look unnatural.
can only be used when one of the test conditon is not a lvalue. some other tips could be using the -Wparanthesis or -Wall when compiling the program
using gcc. --> gcc can suppress warning using if (( i = 0))..  double brackets

2) C books seem to use several different styles of indentation and brace place-
ment for compound statements. Which style is best?
--> there are 4 different ways of plcing indentation and braces - 
k&R styple is the one in which the left brace is placed at the end of a line. 
if (...) {
}  -- this makes the program more compact. and is the mostly used style in Java, one disadvantage is that braces could be hard to find.

Allman style - in it the left brace is on it very own seperate line.
eg: 
if (...)
{
	...
} -- this tyle make it easy to check as braces comes in matching pairs

whitesmith's style -- this style dictates that braces be indented.
if (...) 
	{
	......
	}

GNU style - is the one in which braces are indented, and the innner statements are further indented.
if (...)
	{
		....
	}
--> mmostly used in GNU projects

3) If i is an int variable and f is a float variable, what is the type of the con-
ditional expression ( i > o ? i : f) ?
--> as the expression contains a float value, the conditional expression contains float type. if incase i > 0 is true then
the value of i will be the one after the float conversion.

4) Why doesn't C99 have a better name for its Boolean type?
_Bool is not a good name choice, compared to modern names such as bool and boolean, this is because older programs might
have already used these names, stopping it from compiling.

5) OK, so why wouldn't the 11an1e _ Bool break older programs as ,ve1J?
this is because syntax such as _Bool, which begins with a underscore followed by upper case is reserved for future use and
should not be used by programmers.

6) The template given for the switch staten1ent described it as the "most com-
n1on form." Are tbere other forms?
--> another form different from the common one, would be the switch statement in which the case label is not preceeded by the word case,
this leads to an ammusing(?) trap . suppose we misspelled the word default.
switch(..) {
	...
	**defualt**: ..    // wrong default spelling
} --> in such a case the compiler might not detect the error, since it assumes **defualt** as a ordinary label.

7) I've seen several methods of indenting the switch statement. Which way is
best?
--> there are basically 2 ways of writting switch statements.
it to write the statements right after the switch case label.
switch (coin) {
	case 1: printf(''Cent'');
		break;
	case 5: printf ("Nickel") ;
		break;
	case 10: printf( 11 Dime 11 ) ;
		break;
--> in this the break statement can also be on the same line.
switch ( coin) {
	case l: printf("Cent"); break;
	case 5: printf( 11 Nickel 11 ) ; break;
	case 10: printf("Dime"); break;
	case 25: printf("Quarter"); break;
}

another way of writing switch statement, is the one in which statement are under the case label, indented to make it stand out.
In another variation of the switch statement, we can have all the case label and statements aligned directly under the switch keyword.
