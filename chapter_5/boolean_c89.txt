c89 lacks proper boolean type, this is a drawback as program needing to use true or false values could not be implemented.
one workaround this limitations is by assigining a int value with 0 or 1
example: int flag;
flag = 0;
...
flag = ;

although this works, it is harder for readability, as it assigns boolean value 0 and 1 to the flag
to make program more readable, it became more clearer to use macro definitions such as 
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0

this makes it more readable such that flag = TRUE/FALSE
to test if flag was equal to true --> if (flag == TRUE) ..
this makes it more concise but also because it works even if the flag value changes.
to test if flag was false --> if (flag == FALSE)

we can make it more concise by creating your own type.
#define BOOL int -- this defines a bool type but is actually a int data type.

BOOL flag; --> this makes it easier to read and understand that flag is a boolean. there are better ways to setup a boolean type
using type definitions and enumeration in c98
