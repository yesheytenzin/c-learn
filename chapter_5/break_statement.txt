executing a break statement -- helps to break out of the switch statement
the reason we need break is because switch is basically a computed jump. such that when a controlling experssion is evaluated 
the controls is transferred to the case labels. case label is basically a point in the switch. without break, after the execution of 
the last statement, the control is transferred to the next statement be it, next case statement or a next statement after the switch statement.

switch (grade) {
case 4: printf( " Excellent " ) ;
case 3: printf(flGood'');
case 2: printf ( " Average " ) ;
case 1: printf ( Poor") ;
case O: printf ( " Failing") ;
default: printf (" llegal grade " ) ;
}

in above case as there is no break; in case if the value of grade is 3 then the output is
good,average, poor,failing,illegal grade
--> forgetting to use break is a common mistake but can sometimes be ommited to have multiple case share the same statements;

as falling through case is a rare case it is often best practice to comment and note it;

switch (grade) {
case 4; case 3 : case 2: case l:
	num_passing++;
	/ * FALL THROUGH*/
case 0: total_grades++;
	break;
}

without the comment someone might add break, when it is unnecessary. break should be added to the last case anyway to guard
against missing break error.
