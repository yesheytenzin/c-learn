in c if statement allow a program to perform 2 action based on the condition. c has also another way 
operator that provides one of 2 values depending on the condition

the conditional operator has the symbol ? and : and must be used together.
expressino1 ? expression2 : expression3 --> these expression can be of any type. and the resulting
expressiion is called conditional expression. this is a unique operator that requires 3 operands to function.

in above first expressino1 is evaluated and if value is not zero than second expression2 is evaluated.
if value of expression2 is 0 then expression3 is evaluated;

int i, j, k;

i = 1;
j = 2;
k = i > j ? i : j; // check if i > j and if yes resulting value is i , else it is j --> k = 2
k = (i >= 0 ? i : 0) + j; // k = 3 --which is same as i + j after evaluation

conditional operator make the program shorter but makes it harder to understand. best to avoid them. however is tempting to use in certain cases such as
with return statement. instead of writing
if (i >j)
	return i;
else 
	return j;

we could make it more shorter using - return i > j  ? i : j;

using conditonal with printf is some times more useful --> such as printf("%d\n", i > j ? i : j); instead of if-else with printf("%d\n", i);
conditional expression is also very common in certain kinds of macro definitions
