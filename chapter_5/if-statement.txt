simplest form of if statement is --> if (condition) statement
no need for then keyword as seen in other languages such as example bash scripting

in if statement first the expression/condition in the parenthesis is checked and if it results in true,
then the statement is executed.

eg: 
if (line_num == max_lines)
	line_num = 0;
in above the statement line_num = 0; is executed if the condition/expression lines_num == max_lines is true.

NOTE: == equality and = assignment are not the same thing.
you can test two or more conditions using the and && and or || operators.
but for the statement having && to be executed both left and right operand should be true. and incase of
or || operator either one can be true. 

in the above example if (expression) statement -- is ususally for only one condition.
what about if we need to write more than one statements. in such case we use { statements } --> which treats the entire thing inside the braces as a single statement. i.e is ** compound statement ** 
note: the statements inside the braces are seperated by a semi-colon, but the {} does not end with a semi-colon.
