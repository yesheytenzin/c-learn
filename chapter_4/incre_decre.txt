increment and decrement operators
i = i + 1 could be shorten using compound assignment to  i += 1 which by using increment and decrement operators 
could be further simplified into i++ or i--

complication arises as ++ or -- could either be prefix or postfix

prefix - pre increment or decrement
eg: int i =1;
print ++i --> gives 2
and then print i gives ---> 2

postfix - post increment or decrement
eg: int i =1;
print i++ --> gives 1 and
then print i gives 2

note: postfix i++ have higher precedence than +i or -i (uniary)
