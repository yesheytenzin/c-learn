simplest c assignment operator is = (equals)
unlike other langauages where = is considered as statement; in c = is considered as an operator as it produces a reasult;
example --> v = e is the value of v after assignment;
if int i = 72.99f then after the assignment is 72 and not 71.99

side effects - adding i + j as in mathematics does not result in chnage in values of i an j 
evaluating i =0 results in 0 and side effects is i is assigned value 0

chained side effects
eg:
int i;
float j;

j = i = 72.99f --> i value is assigned as 72 and as for j it is assigned as 72.0 and not 72.99f

lvalues
in c most operatord allow their operands to be constants, int, variables but assignment operators requires an lvalue as its left operands.
lvalue is value which is stored in memory and not in a varibale or is computed.
example expression such as 10 and i * 5 is not an lvalue
 correct exmaple -> i=10 but  -10 = i is wrong

compount assignment
is the mathod  of shortening the long expresssion example=> i += 2 which is same as i = i + 2
some other example includes -=, *= , /= and %=

howver note that i +=e is not equivalent to i = i + e always, as the result may differ in some cases;
other example where such cases could be found are in i *= j + k is not equivalent to i = (i*j) + k,
this is due to the special condition known as side effect associated with assignment i.e =
if you meant to compile i +=j but happen to write j +=i , program may complile but the logic and ouput may be unexpected.

compount assignment simillar to assignment operator are right associative
eg: i +=j += k means i += (j += k
