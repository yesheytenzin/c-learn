diff between %i and %d 
-- both can read int values
-- but %d only read int value of base 10
-- wheread %i reads int value of base 8 and base 16, even base 10

to print % charcter in printf jsut repeat %%

what if input ask for numeric valur but user enter numeric followed by non numeric-value
-- scanf will read only numeric value and skips the rest or try it in next scanf call


scanf put back -- does not mean it pust the data in the variable on read, but stores in temp buffer

what happens if user put comman in between 2 int user input??
user read fiest int and then it encounters the comma, so it stores the first int and waits for next scanf call
