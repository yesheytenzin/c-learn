# Learning C – "C Programming: A Modern Approach" (2nd Edition) by K. N. King

My personal workspace while working through **C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition** by K. N. King — widely regarded as one of the best (and clearest) books for learning modern C (covering C89 and C99 standards).

This repo includes:
- My typed-out versions of the book's example programs
- Solutions to exercises and programming projects
- Small notes on tricky parts, gotchas, or things that clicked for me
- Occasional mini-projects inspired by the chapters

Goal: Build a strong foundation in C, understand low-level concepts, and eventually feel comfortable reading/writing real C code (systems programming, embedded, etc.).

Started in February 2026 from Thimphu, Bhutan.

## Book Details

- **Author**: K. N. King
- **Edition**: 2nd (2008) – still excellent in 2026!
- **Focus**: Clear explanations, lots of exercises (~500 total), C89 + C99 features
- **Official site**: http://knking.com/books/c2/
- **Why this book?** Great structure, no fluff, strong emphasis on understanding (not just memorizing syntax).
