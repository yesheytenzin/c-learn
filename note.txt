C has 3 main components
directives -- bascially libraries that begin with #
functions -- block of code eg. int main(void)
statement -- lines of code

C compiler working
preprocessor -> compiler -> linker

command intended for preprocessor is called directives. use to modify program before compiling
cc -o pun pun.c 
gcc compiler
gcc -oo pun pun.c

declarations
mostly used to declare variable
type { name }

initiliazation inside declarations
eg: int height = 10;

identifier -- basically names for variables, functions, marros -- must begin with letter or _underscore
use lowercase except for macros

c program -- series of token - group of characters that can't be broken without altering their meaning
float stored in 2 components - mantissa/fraction and an exponent - 12.0 stored as 1.5 * 2^3

keywords -- reserved words that can't be used as identifiers

macro definitions -- as for macro definitions of expressions should be in ()
#define inches_per_pound 166

#directives

int main(void)
{
	declarations
	statements
}
